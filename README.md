# Crime-Analysis-based-on-Kerala-Police-Official-Data
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of crime data collected from the official Kerala Police website. The project focuses on analyzing data from four police stations in Trivandrum: Mannanthala, Medical College, Kazhakootam, and Peroorkada. The analysis provides insights into crime trends, patterns, and clusters in these urban areas.

## Project Overview

**Files and Structure**

-**CRIME ANALYSIS.ipynb:** A Jupyter Notebook performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. Key libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib have been utilized.

-**Comprehensive Crime Analysis of Key Urban Areas In Trivandrum.pdf:** A detailed report summarizing the findings of the crime analysis.

-**README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project and its contents.

-**crime analysis.pbix:** A Power BI file for dynamic visualizations and dashboards.

-**crime data.xlsx:** The dataset sourced from the Kerala Police official website, containing crime records from the four selected stations.

## Methodology

**Data Collection:**

-The dataset was sourced from the official Kerala Police website.

-Data from Mannanthala, Medical College, Kazhakootam, and Peroorkada police stations were compiled to form a representative cluster.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

-Conducted using Python with Jupyter Notebook.

-Visualized data using matplotlib to identify trends and correlations.

-Key insights on crime patterns and hotspots were identified.

**Dynamic Visualization:**

-Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI.

-Visualizations allow for a deeper exploration of data trends and patterns.

**Reporting:**

A comprehensive PDF report summarizing findings and insights from the analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

-**Python:** For data preprocessing and EDA.

-**Matplotlib:** For static visualizations.

-**Power BI:** For creating dynamic, interactive dashboards.

-**Excel:** For initial data storage and basic formatting.

## Key Findings

-Detailed insights into crime patterns across the four police stations.

-Identification of high-crime areas and times.

-Analysis of the types of crimes and their frequency in each station's jurisdiction.
